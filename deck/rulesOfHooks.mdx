- Call Hooks at the "Top Level"
  - Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions

    ```jsx
  // ðŸ”´ We're breaking the first rule by using a Hook in a condition
  if (name !== '') {
    useEffect(function persistForm() {
      localStorage.setItem('formData', name);
    });
  }
```
